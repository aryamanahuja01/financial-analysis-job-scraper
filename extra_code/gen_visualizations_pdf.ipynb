    "The visualizations in the Visualizations.pdf file were created using Python by first querying the PostgreSQL database with pandas.read_sql() to create four dataframes based on descriptive and diagnostic analytics queries for both the remote_jobs and indeed_jobs datasets. Each dataframe was then visualized using matplotlib and seaborn to generate bar charts and other relevant plots that illustrate the insights and trends identified in the SQL queries. All visualizations were compiled into a single multi-page PDF file using matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf.PdfPages, resulting in a consolidated report that can be easily shared or reviewed."
